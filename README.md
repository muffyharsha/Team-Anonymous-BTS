**Theme -** GIS for effective Traffic management of Bangalore (Special Category)

## Description
The traffic situation in Bengaluru is inevitably a matter of trouble for its commuters. A city with such thriving population needs state-of-the-art Technology to attend to its high infrastructure needs. This project ***"AI for Traffic Signal Control"*** aims to maximize the tech utilization to come up with a frugal and adaptive solution for the problem.

Preliminary Objectives:
* 40% reduction in average waiting time 
* Pre-emption system to ease movement of priority vehicles (Ambulances, Fire engines)

The proposed system aims to minimize waiting times for motorized vehicles in traffic junctions. The model takes Queue Lengths and Average Speeds of vehicles in different lanes corresponding to a junction as input and provides the traffic light configuration for the junction as output. It also includes a pre-emption system to ease priority vehicle movement across the city.

**NOTE** - ***Descriptions** and **Instructions to Run** are in the Readme within Modules*

### Module 1 - Extraction of Queue Lengths
Extraction of vehicular density data from video feed
* OpenCV
* FCNN Algorithm, YOLO Architecture

### Module 2 - Traffic Light Configuration Module
* Simuation of Deep Q Learning
* Sumo(Simulation of Urban MObility) tool with TraCI module for traffic interfacing
